# WALMART_DATA_ANALYSIS

Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics pipeline for analyzing Walmart Sales Data using Python, SQL (MySQL), and the Kaggle API. The goal is to extract meaningful business insights about sales performance, profitability, and customer behavior through a structured and reproducible data workflow.

Starting with environment setup and dataset acquisition via the Kaggle API, the project progresses through data cleaning, feature engineering, and database integration. Cleaned and enriched data is loaded into MySQL databases using SQLAlchemy, enabling complex SQL queries to answer key business questions such as identifying top-performing branches, best-selling categories, revenue trends, and customer purchasing patterns.

The analysis is supported by Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and sqlalchemy for data manipulation and integration, ensuring smooth data flow between local files and databases. Results highlight sales insights, profitability analysis, and customer behavior trends, providing a clear understanding of Walmart’s operational performance.

Future improvements include integrating interactive dashboards (Power BI/Tableau), automating the data pipeline for real-time updates, and expanding the dataset for deeper insights.
